My name is Eyvind Niklasson and I'm a machine learning engineer/data scientist and pentester (in my free time). I graduated with a B.A. and M.Eng both from Cornell University in Computer Science and I'm interested in (non-ironically) making the world a better place. While I figure out how to do that, I hope to dive into some topics that I find fascinating. Currently I'm enthralled by some of the work coming out of the the Deep Reinforcement Learning world.
