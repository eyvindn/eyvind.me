## who are you / what do you do?
I'm currently a~~n AI Resident~~ Research Engineer at Google working on self organising systems with [Alexander Mordvintsev](https://znah.net/). It's a [very exciting field](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/). I've also [dabbled](https://bughunters.google.com/profile/c7fc560e-70f4-44e7-8287-0ca16ee7ea4d) in [infosec](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/thanks/).
